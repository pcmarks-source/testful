TESTful is a simple WebApp for testing RESTful APIs.

Capable of sending the basic HTTP method requests, delivering a few basic (although customizable) headers, delivering payloads formatted in Json, HTML or Plain-Text and parsing HTTP responses (in a rather ugly fashion).

In addition, there is a simple RESTful API built in that will respond to GET requests with predefined text and POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests with HTTP body content echoes. The echo API can predictably be found by adding /echo/ to the address where you're hosting TESTful.

TESTful was written as an exercise on full stack development for dotnet and is not intended to be used in any real capacity. If you've somehow stumbled across this and find it useful - please just download postman from the link below. It's what TESTful was modeled after, is far more polished and has many more features.
